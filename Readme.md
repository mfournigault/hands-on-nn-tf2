# Introduction

This repository contains the code of exercises included in the book "Hand-on Neural Networks with TensorFlow 2.0" by Paolo Galeone. The book is published by Packt Publishing. 
In this repository you will also some extra codes for exercises described in the section "Exercises" of the chapters and not provided by the author.
It is important to notice as well that I corrected some errors in the code provided by the author in the book.

# Environment and execution

## For exercises with tensorflow 1
To run the code with tensorflow 1 in this repository I created a virtual environement with python 3.7 and tensorflow 1.15.

## For exercises with tensorflow 2
To run the code with tensorflow 2 in this repository I created a virtual environement with python 3.10 and tensorflow 2.15.
It is important to note that tensorflow 2.15 is the latest version with the implementation of Keras 2. It was the chosen version because the book was written with tensorflow 2 and Keras 2.
After the version 2.16, tensorflow implements and uses Keras 3. Major changes appeared with Keras 3 and we do not advice its usage for the exercises described in the book.
